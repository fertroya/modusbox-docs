= Debatching Incoming XML Document Sets

Purchase orders (POs) sent in XML format are typically enclosed in a GS envelope, which is in turn enclosed in an ISA envelope. In order to process the POs, they must be _debatched_: that is, separated so that each PO is enclosed in its own GS envelopes, shown in <<img-xml-debatching>>.

This page shows how GearCo uses xref:document-types[Document Types] to debatch an ISA envelope containing a GS and multiple STs.

=== About Automatic Debatching

Note that, in <<img-document-type-parents-tab>>, automatic debatching is selected for the GS Document Type, and a shredding path is configured; if you were to view the corresponding page and tab for the GS and ISA documents, you would see that they are also configured in this manner. Thus, when this ISA Document Type is received, it will automatically debatch from an ISA containing a GS containing _x_ 850s to _x_ separate ISAs, each containing a GS and an 850, as shown in <<img-isa-gs-st-debatching>>.
