== *Introduction*

The _PortX JDE Connector_ leverages the internal capabilities of Oracle’s _JD Edwards EnterpriseOne™_ solution to a broader extent, and uses the power of Oracle’s Java Dynamic Connector to provide interoperability with _JD Edwards EnterpriseOne™_ and external systems.

After reading this guide, you should be able to submut a batch process on the server.

At design time, the _PortX JDE Connector_ allows you to discover functions by name providing full access to all Business Function signatures. Given that discovery is a heavy duty process, the Connector manages a cache repository for all function’s metadata used at least once.

The results of a function call will be injected into the flow as a Map containing key-value pairs with the invocation’s output values. This approach gives the end user freedom of choice to construct complex flows and manage custom exception strategies.

Furthermore, you can have all functions in the flow, processing within the same transaction, and commit or rollback all changes.

=== Prerequisites

This document assumes that you are familiar with Oracle’s _JD Edwards EnterpriseOne™_ basics, Mule the https://docs.mulesoft.com/anypoint-studio/v/6/download-and-launch-anypoint-studio[Anypoint™ Studio] interface.

=== Requirements

* *Review the* link:/[PortX JDE Connector for Mule 4 – Getting Started Guide] for a detailed list of requirements and setup prerequisites.

== *Demo Project - Submit a Batch Process*

NOTE: It is recommended that you update AnyPoint Studio before starting with a _PortX JDE Connector_ project.

=== Creating a new Mule Project 

Create a new Mule Project with Mule Server 4.1.1 EE or greater as runtime:

image:demo_ube/image1_demo_ube.png[image,width=321,height=423]

=== Project Dependencies

In you pom.xml, add the following to you _repositories_ section :
[source,xml]
----
<repository>
    <id>portx-repository-releases</id>
    <name>portx-repository-releases</name>
    <url>https://portx.jfrog.io/portx/portx-releases</url>
</repository>
----

Add the following to you _dependencies_ section :

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
<groupId>com.modus</groupId>
    <artifactId>mule-jde-connector</artifactId>
    <version>2.0.0</version>
    <classifier>mule-plugin</classifier>
</dependency>
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.jdedwards</groupId>
    <artifactId>jde-lib-bundle</artifactId>
    <version>1.0.0</version>
</dependency>
----

Add or update the following to you _plugins_ section :
[source,xml]
----
<plugin>
    <groupId>org.mule.tools.maven</groupId>
    <artifactId>mule-maven-plugin</artifactId>
    <version>$\{mule.maven.plugin.version}</version>
    <extensions>true</extensions>
    <configuration>
        <sharedLibraries>
            <sharedLibrary>
                <groupId>com.jdedwards</groupId>
                <artifactId>jde-lib-bundle</artifactId>
            </sharedLibrary>
        </sharedLibraries>
    </configuration>
</plugin>
----
=== Required files

Copy the _JD Edwards EntrpriseOne™_ configuration files to the following folders within the project:

* Project Root
* _src/main/resources_

NOTE: If there is a requirement to use different configuration files per environment, you may create separate folders under _src/main/resources_ corresponding to each environment as shown below.

image:demo_ube/image2_demo_ube.png[image,width=250,height=446]

The _mule-arifact.json_ file needs to be updated per environment as below

[source,json]
----
{
	"minMuleVersion": "4.1.4",
	"classLoaderModelLoaderDescriptor": {
		"id": "mule",
		"attributes": {
			"exportedResources": [
				"JDV920/jdeinterop.ini",
				"JDV920/jdbj.ini",
				"JDV920/tnsnames.ora",
				"JDV920/jdelog.properties",
				"JPY920/jdeinterop.ini",
				"JPY920/jdbj.ini",
				"JPY920/tnsnames.ora",
				"JPY920/jdelog.properties",				
				"log4j2.xml"
			],
			"exportedPackages": [
				"JDV920",
				"JPY920"
			],
			"includeTestDependencies": "true"
		}
	}
}
----

=== Other Considerations

To redirect the _JD Edwards EntrpriseOne™_ Logger to Mule Logger (allowing you to see the JDE activity in both Console and JDE files defined in the _jdelog.properties_, you may add the following _Async Loggers_ to _log4j2.xml_ file.

[source,xml]
----
<!-- JDE Connector wire logging -->
<AsyncLogger name="org.mule.modules.jde.handle.MuleHandler" level="INFO" />
<AsyncLogger name="org.mule.modules.jde.JDEConnector" level="INFO" />
----
=== Troubleshooting

If you are having trouble resolving all dependencies,

. Shut down AnyPoint Studio
. Run the following command in the project root folder from the terminal/command prompt,

_mvn clean install_

[start=3]
. Open AnyPoint Studio and check dependencies again.

=== Configure the Global Element

To use the _PortX JDE Connector_ in your Mule application, you must configure a global element that can be used by the connector (read more about Global Elements).

Open the Mule flow for the project, and select the Global Elements tab at the bottom of the Editor Window.

image:demo_ube/image3_demo_ube.png[image,width=515,height=273]

Click Create

image:demo_ube/image4_demo_ube.png[image,width=511,height=312]

Type “JDE” in the filter edit box, and select “JDE Config”. Click OK

image:demo_ube/image5_demo_ube.png[image,width=386,height=390]

On the _General_ tab, enter the required credential and environment

image:demo_ube/image6_demo_ube.png[image,width=378,height=383]

Click _Test Connection._ You should see the following message appear.

image:demo_ube/image7_demo_ube.png[image,width=513,height=135]

You are now ready to start using the _PortX JDE Connector_ in your project

=== Creating a HTTP Listener for your flow

*NOTE :* This use case example will create a simple flow to submit a job for UBE R0008P_XJDE0001 on _Oracle’s JDE EnterpriseOne_ Server.

Go back to the _Message Flow_ tab

image:demo_ube/image8_demo_ube.png[image,width=615,height=459]

From the Mule Palette (typically top right), select _HTTP_, and drag Listener to the canvas

image:demo_ube/image9_demo_ube.png[image,width=263,height=286]

Select the _HTTP Listener_ component from the canvas, and inspect the properties window

image:demo_ube/image10_demo_ube.png[image,width=655,height=390]

The connector requires a _Connector Configuration_. Click on *Add* to create a connector configuration.

Give the HTTP endpoint a more descriptive name like _get-submitR0008P-http-endpoint_ and press *OK* to go back to the global HTTP endpoint dialog box:

image:demo_ube/image11_demo_ube.png[image,width=415,height=420]

Add a path to the URL eg. _submitR0008P_XJDE0001._

image:demo_ube/image12_demo_ube.png[image,width=601,height=252]

Save the project. The connector will be ready to process requests.

=== Submit a Batch Process / Report

Locate the *JDE* Connector, and select Submit batch process. Drag this to the canvas.

image:demo_ube/image13_demo_ube.png[image,width=331,height=232]

Drag the connector over to the canvas. Select it and review the properties window. Give it a meaningful name eg. Submit R0008P_XJDE0001.

Under the General section, click on the drop-down for UBE Name

image:demo_ube/image14_demo_ube.png[image,width=601,height=253]

*NOTE :* If it is the first time you are selecting a UBE, this might take a while, as no information has been cached yet. It will need to build a list of all UBEs available. Please be patient. The status bar (bottom right) will display the following while it is retrieving the metadata.

image:demo_ube/image15_demo_ube.png[image,width=307,height=30]

===== Troubleshooting
If the operation fails (possibly due to a timeout), you will see the below message

image:demo_ube/troubleshoot_timeout_message.png[image,width=345,height=115]

Please review the timeout settings in _Anypoint Studio_'s Preferences.

To do this go the the _Window > Preferences_ menu

image:demo_ube/troubleshoot_preferences_menu.png[image,width=154,height=199]

Go to _Anypoint Studio > DataSense_ and change the _DataSense Connection Timeout_ setting as below

image:demo_ube/troubleshoot_datasense_timeout.png[image,width=622,height=551]

Go to _Anypoint Studio > Tooling_ and change the _Default Connection Timeout_ and _Default Read Timeout_ settings as below

image:demo_ube/troubleshoot_timeout_tooling.png[image,width=622,height=551]

==== Setting Parameters
After the system has retrieved the required metadata, select R0008P_XJDE0001 from the list. The specification metadata will be retrieved from the enterprise server, and put into the project metadata repository.

image:demo_ube/image12_demo_ube.png[image,width=601,height=252]

You may now assign the input parameters. You can do this by either entering the payload values manually, or via the “Show Graphical View” button.

image:demo_ube/image16_demo_ube.png[image,width=586,height=225]

Drag the inputs to outputs, or double-click the output parameter to add to your edit window, and change as required. Eg.

*_Job Queue* : [Enter the Job Queue or leave blank for the default job queue

*_Selection* : F0010.CO = ''00000'' (See link:#appendix-a-how-define-data-selection[Appendix A] for data selection details)

*cFiscalDatePattern* : F

image:demo_ube/image17_demo_ube.png[image,width=601,height=218]

=== Set Payload Output

In the Mule Palette, you can either select Core, scroll down to Transformers or type “Payload” in the search bar.

image:demo_ube/image18_demo_ube.png[image,width=325,height=246]

Drag and drop the _Set Payload_ to your canvas.

image:demo_ube/image19_demo_ube.png[image,width=280,height=262]

Select the Set Payload component, and review the properties.

image:demo_ube/image20_demo_ube.png[image,width=601,height=157]

Change the payload to reflect the desired output, and save the project

image:demo_ube/image21_demo_ube.png[image,width=601,height=174]

=== Testing the Mule Flow

To Test your flow, you need to start the Mule application. Go to the _Run_ menu, and select _Run_.

image:demo_ube/image22_demo_ube.png[image,width=461,height=305]

After the project has been deployed, you can test you flow by typing the URL into a web browser eg. http://localhost:8081/submitR0008P_XJDE0001

image:demo_ube/image23_demo_ube.png[image,width=403,height=126]

Log into JD Edwards EnterpriseOne and View Job Status for the user specified in the global element eg. JDE

image:demo_ube/image24_demo_ube.png[image,width=601,height=125]

=== Handling exceptions

From your Mule Pallete, select and drag the _Error Handler_ to your canvas

image:demo_ube/image25_demo_ube.png[image,width=261,height=336]image:demo_ube/image26_demo_ube.png[image,width=294,height=335]

Now select and drag the _On Error Continue_ into the _Error Handler_

image:demo_ube/image27_demo_ube.png[image,width=220,height=118]

Select the _On Error Continue_ scope, and under Type enter _JDE:ERROR_SUBMITTING_UBE_

image:demo_ube/image28_demo_ube.png[image,width=529,height=253]

NOTE : The operation error types can be seen when selecting the operation on your canvas, going to _Error Mapping_, and clicking add. You may also map this error to a aplication specific error.

image:demo_ube/image29_demo_ube.png[image,width=231,height=268]

Drag the _Set Payload_ component to the _Error Handler_, and set an appropriate message

image:demo_ube/image30_demo_ube.png[image,width=506,height=202]

=== Defining Data Selection

* The parameter _Selection_ is used to define UBE Data Selection.
* The sentence is similar to a WHERE clause of an SQL statement.
* The _Selection_ syntax is:
** table.column_name operator [value|table.column_name];
* The table must be a JDE table that belongs to the main view of the UBE.
* Column Name must be a JDE Data Item Alias.
* The following operators can be used in the _Selection_ :

[cols=",",options="header",]
|===
|Operator |Description
|= |Equal
|<> |Not equal
|<> |Not equal
|> |Greater than
|< |Less than
|>= |Greater than or equal
|⇐ |Less than or equal
|BETWEEN |Between an inclusive range
|NOT BETWEEN |Not Between an exclusive range
|IN |To specify multiple possible values for a column
|NOT IN |To exclude multiple possible values for a column
|===

* The values can be literals or other table columns.
* Literals can be String or Number
* The sentence can include the AND and/or the OR conditions
* To override the default precedence you need to use parenthesis as
** C1 AND (C2 OR C3)
** The sentence only accept one level of Parenthesis.

For example, this is a valid sentence because the maximum level of Parenthesis opened is 1.

_C1 AND (C2 OR C3) AND (C4 OR C5)_

otherwise, this is an invalid sentences because the maximum level of Parenthesis opened is 2.

C1 AND (C2 OR (C3 AND C4))

Examples:

[source,sql]
----
F4211.KCOO = '00001' AND F4211.DOCO > 10332
F4211.KCOO = '00001' AND F4211.DOCO >= 10332
F4211.KCOO = '00001' AND F4211.DOCO <= 10332
F4211.KCOO = '00001' AND F4211.DOCO <> 10332
F4211.KCOO = '00001' AND ( F4211.DCTO = 'SO' OR F4211.DCTO = 'SI' )
F4211.KCOO = '00001' AND F4211.DCTO IN ('SO','SI')
F4211.KCOO = '00001' AND F4211.DCTO NOT IN ('SO','SI')
F4211.KCOO = '00001' AND F4211.DOCO BETWEEN 1022 AND 400
F4211.KCOO = '00001' AND F4211.DOCO NOT BETWEEN 1022 AND 400
F4211.MCU = F4211.EMCU AND F4211.DOCO NOT BETWEEN 1022 AND 400
