In this scenario, an xref:glossary#A[Application] sends a xref:glossary#D[Document] to a xref:glossary#P[Partner].

== Background Reading

xref:actors-relationships-and-artifacts.adoc[Actors, Relationships and Artifacts]:: Introduces foundational IHub terminology. 

xref:transaction-processing-framework.adoc[Transaction-Processing Framework]:: Explains how IHub works.

== Relationships

There are four xref:glossary#R[Relationships] in this scenario:

|===
|Relationship|Description|Contains


s|AppA : Any
|Universal Relationship between Application A and any other Application
|Contains xref:glossary#A[Artifacts] specific to transactions between Application *A* and any other Application.

s|_YourCompany_ B2B : Any
|Universal relationship between your company and any partner
|Contains Artifacts used across all partners with whom you do business

s|_YourCompany_ B2B ; AppA
|Relationship between this applcation and the Home Partner (*_YourCompany_ B2B*)
|Contains Artifacts specific to transactions between Application *A* and the Home Partner

s|_YourCompany_ B2B : PartA
|Your company's relationship with the partner with whom you are doing business (in this case, *PartA*).

==== *AppA* sends Document of Document Type *Y* to Endpoint *RecFromA*

Integration Hub:

* Receives Document Y
* Attempts to resolve routes
* Finds Transaction *Y-to-X-to-Router*
* Executes that transaction, which maps the document to Document Type *X*
* Sends Document *Y* to Endpoint *Router*
* Attempts to resolve routes
* Finds Transaction *X-to-Z-to-PartA*
* Executes that transaction, which maps the document to Document Type *Z*
* Sends Document *Z* to Endpoint *PartA*
