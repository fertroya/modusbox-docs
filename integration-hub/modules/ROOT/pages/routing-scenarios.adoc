= Routing Scenarios

Pages in this section present examples of scenarios that identify and illustrate:

* Integration Hub (IHub) xref:actors-relationships-and-artifacts.adoc[Actors, Relationships and Artifacts]
* How you can configure these IHub components to implement routing objectives.

Your organization receives a document from a Partner. If IHub has been configured to receive a document of this Document Type, IHub routes the document to an internal API. If IHub has not been configured to receive a document of this Document Type, IHub rejects the document.

== xref:shared-routing-scenario.adoc[Shared]

Your organization wants to receive a document Document from two Partners, map it to an internal standard, and send it to a backend database.

== xref:override-routing-scenario.adoc[Override]

[[img-override-routing-scenario-overview]]

image::override-routing-scenario-overview.png[img-override-routing-scenario-overview, title="Override Routing Scenario Overview"]

In this scenario, your organization expects to receive documents of a single Document Type from multiple Partners.

If IHub has been configured to receive a document of this Document Type, IHub routes the document to an internal API.

However, one partner uses a variation of the Document Type, so you must override the standard Map that you use to transform that partnerâ€™s Document Type to your internal Document Type before routing.

If IHub has not been configured to receive a document of this Document Type, IHub rejects the document.

== xref:multi-route-routing-scenario.adoc[Multi-Route]

[[img-multi-route-routing-scenario-overview]]

image::multi-route-routing-scenario-overview.png[img-multi-route-routing-scenario-overview, title="Multi-Route Routing Scenario Overview"]

Your organization receives a document from a partner.
IHub has been configured to process the document in two ways:

* Route a copy of the document to an internal API
* Route a copy of the document directly to a destination you use to backup received documents. This routing is referred to as *passthru* because it does not require a map.  

== xref:multicast-routing-scenario.adoc[Multicast]

[[img-multicast-routing-scenario-overview]]

image::multicast-routing-scenario-overview.png[img-multicast-routing-scenario-overview, title="Multicast Routing Scenario Overview"]

An Application sends a document to three other Applications. Two of the Applications require the document as-sent; the third requires the payload to be mapped.

== xref:chained-transactions-routing-scenario.adoc[Chained Transactions]

[[img-chained-transactions-routing-scenario-overview]]

image::chained-transactions-routing-scenario-overview.png[img-chained-transactions-routing-scenario-overview, title="Chained Transactions Routing Scenario Overview"]

An Application sends a document to a Partner.

== xref:content-based-routing-routing-scenario.adoc[Content-Based-Routing] 

[[img-basic-routing-scenario-overview]]

image::basic-routing-scenario-overview.png[img-basic-routing-scenario-overview, title="Basic Routing Scenario Overview"]

Your organization receives a document from a Partner. Depending on the size of a property in that document, Integration Hub routes the document to an endpoint DataBig or an endpoint DataSmall.
