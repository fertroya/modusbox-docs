= Actors, Relationships, and Artifacts

This page introduces and defines Integration Hub's fundamental building blocks: 
xref:glossary#A[Actor]s, xref:glossary#R[Relationship]s, and xref:glossary#A[Artifact]s.

== Actors

An IHub 
xref:glossary#A[Actor] 
is an entity that you can pair with another xref:glossary#A[Actor] to form a 
xref:glossary#R[Relationship].

An xref:glossary#A[Actor] contains: 

* xref:glossary#I[Identifier]s that identify it to IHub
* xref:glossary#C[Certificate]s 
(if you add them)

There are four types of xref:glossary#A[Actor]s:

* <<Partners>>
* <<Applications>>
* <<your-company-b2b>>
* <<Any>>

=== Partners

A xref:glossary#P[Partner] is an organization that exchanges B2B xref:glossary#D[document]s with your organization, such as *PartA* in xref:basic-routing-scenario.adoc[Basic Routing Scenario]. 

=== Applications

An 
xref:glossary#A[Application]
is a software program, or group of programs, that have a role within your organization, such as *AppA* in xref:application-sends-to-partner-routing-scenario.adoc[Application-Sends-to-Partner Routing Scenario].


[[your-company-b2b, **_YourCompany_ B2B**]]
=== _YourCompany_ B2B


*_YourCompany_ B2B* is your organization's gateway between its applications and its <<Partners>>. You can see how this xref:glossary#A[Actor] works in xref:basic-routing-scenario.adoc[Basic Routing Scenario].

=== Any

*Any* refers to all shared application-specific information. You can see how this xref:glossary#A[Actor] works in xref:basic-routing-scenario.adoc[Basic Routing Scenario].

== Relationships

You can connect one xref:secta[Actor] to another to form a xref:glossary#R[Relationship]. A xref:glossary#R[Relationship] is the union of an xref:glossary#A[Actor] with another xref:glossary#A[Actor] for the purpose of partitioning 
xref:glossary#A[Artifact]s. For example, xref:basic-routing-scenario#relationships.adoc[Basic Routing Scenario] illustrates the use of two xref:glossary#R[Relationship]s: 

*_YourCompany_ B2B : Any* :: Universal xref:glossary#R[Relationship] between your company and any xref:glossary#A[Actor]
*_YourCompany_ B2B : PartA* :: Your organization's xref:glossary#R[Relationship] with the xref:glossary#P[Partner] with whom you are doing business (in xref:basic-routing-scenario.adoc[Basic Routing Scenario], this is *PartA*)

== Artifacts

An xref:glossary#A[Artifact] is a software component of the IHub system that resides in a xref:glossary#R[Relationship]. This section identifies all IHub xref:glossary#A[Artifact]s.

=== xref:glossary#D[Document Type]

Identifies types of xref:glossary#D[document]s based on values such as xref:glossary#S[Standard] and xref:glossary#M[Message Type].

=== xref:glossary#E[Endpoint]

Entry point to a service, process, queue or topic destination. 

=== xref:glossary#C[Channel]

Grouping of xref:glossary#A[Artifact]s 
specific to a transmission. 

=== xref:glossary#M[Map] 

Transforms one xref:glossary#D[Document Type] to another xref:glossary#D[Document Type].

=== xref:glossary#sect[Transaction]

The end-to-end processing of a single instance of a xref:glossary#D[document] from receipt at an xref:glossary#E[Endpoint] all the way to the appropriate business service.
