= Transaction Monitoring

PortX enables you to monitor B2B _transaction_ data.
A transaction is the full set of end-to-end events (including transmissions, documents, and errors) involved in processing a transmission.

You can:

* Filter to find the specific transaction data for which you are looking
* Review and monitor errors and acknowledgements.
* Search for metadata

This page identifies the PortX components you use to monitor transactions; see also xref:tracking-scenarios.adoc[Tracking Scenarios].
