= One Document, Multiple Routes Routing Scenario

In this scenario, your organization expects to receive xref:glossary#sectd[document]s of a single xref:glossary#sectd[Document Type] from multiple xref:glossary#sectp[Partner]s. 
However, 

as in the xref:basic-routing-scenario.adoc[Basic Routing Scenario].

If IH has been configured to receive a document of this xref:glossary#sectd[Document Type], IH routes the document to an internal API. 
If IH has not been configured to receive a document of this Document Type, IH rejects the document. 


=== Relationships

There are x xref:glossary#sectr[Relationships] in this scenario:

=== Artifacts and Artifact Configuration 

This section identifies:

* Artifacts that must be configured in order for the document in this scenario to be routed (that is, not rejected)
* The Relationship (either *YourCompany B2B : Any* or *YourCompany B2B : PartA*) in which the artifacts are configured

=== Outcomes

The outcome of this scenario depends on whether the following artifacts are configured appropriately:

* Partner *PartA*
* Partner *PartB*
* Partner *PartC*
* Document Type *DocTypeX*
* Document Type *DocTypeX'*
* Document Type *DocTypeY*
* Endpoint *RecFromA*
* Endpoint *RecFromB*
* Endpoint *RecFromC*
* Endpoint *API*
* Map *X-to-Y*
* Map *X'-to-Y*
* Source Channel *X-to-Y*
* Source Channel *X'-to-Y*
* Target Channel *Y-to-API*
* Transaction *X-to-Y-to-API*
* Transaction *X'-to-Y-to-API*

=== Outcomes

==== PartA sends Document X to Endpoint RecFromA.
* Integration Manager:

** Receives Document Q

** Attempts to resolve routes
** Finds Transaction DocQ-to-DocC-to-DATA
** Executes that transaction, which maps the transaction to Document C

**  Sends Document C to Endpoint DATA.

==== PartB sends Document X to Endpoint RecFromB.

* Integration Manager:

** Receives Document Q

** Attempts to resolve routes
** Finds Transaction DocQ-to-DocC-to-DATA
** Executes that transaction, which maps the transaction to Document C

**  Sends Document C to Endpoint DATA.

image::override-routing-scenario-outcome-success.png[img-override-routing-scenario-outcome-success, title="Override Routing Scenario Outcome (Success)"]

==== PartC sends Document X' to Endpoint RecFromC

Integration Manager:

** Receives Document X'

** Attempts to resolve routes
** Finds Transaction DocX'-to-DocY-to-API
** Executes that transaction, which maps the transaction to Document Y

**  Sends Document Y to Endpoint API.

==== Outcome: Document Rejected

Partner *PartA* sends a document of Document Type *DocTypeZ* to Endpoint *RecFromA*. 
Document Type *DocTypeZ* is not configured in Relationship *YourCompany B2B : Any*; IH rejects the document. 

Integration Hub:

* Receives incoming document.
* Attempts to resolve Routes.
* Does not find a corresponding Transaction.
* Rejects the document.
