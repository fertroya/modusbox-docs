== Configure a Partner

This tutorial works with two partners:

* *GearCo B2B*, a fictional skateboard retailer, also identified on the xref:img-partners-and-applications[] 
as *YOUR COMPANY*.

NOTE: In your copy of IHub, *YOUR COMPANY* is probably not named *GearCo B2B*. However, for illustration purposes, we refer to *YOUR COMPANY* as *GearCo B2B* throughout this tutorial. If you want to change the name of *YOUR COMPANY* to *GearCo B2B*, see xref:partner-configuration#create-and-configure-partners[Create and Configure Partners]. However, the tutorial will work without making this change.

== Create a Source Channel

A _channel_ provides a means of specifying, for a given partner:

Type:: Source or Target, As created in xref:maps[Channels] or in xref:transaction-designer[Transaction Designer]. Source Channel settings are always specific to the origin of a document. Target Channel settings are always specific to the destination.
Document:: As created in xref:document-types[Document Types] or in xref:transaction-designer[Transaction Designer]
Document Map:: As created in xref:maps[Maps] or in xref:transaction-designer[Transaction Designer]
Endpoint:: As created in xref:endpoints[Endpoints] or in xref:transaction-designer[Transaction Designer]

=== Create the Target Document Type for the Source Channel

The terms  _document_, _file_, and _message_ are used interchangeably in the B2B world to reflect an instance of a structured payload being passed through a system to convey information about a transaction. For consistency, we use the term document to represent these instances.

IHub enables you to categorize and configure specific _Document Types_. In this section, you create a Source Document Type for the Target Channel.

. On the xref:img-transaction-workspace[], in the Source Channel Card, click *Add Map*.   
+
The Source Channel Card expands to display the xref:img-target-document-card[]. 
+

[.text-center]
Source Channel: the Source Document and the Target document are different. 














=== Configure Endpoints

An _endpoint_ is the entry point to a service, a process, or a queue or topic destination in service-oriented architecture.
In IHub, an endpoint defines the protocol, address, and other details specific to an exchange of messages between partners.

== Design a Source Channel

== Configure an S3 Bucket (optional)

Configuring an Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) bucket enables you to view message payloads in <<Monitor the Transaction>>. You will add configuration data from the bucket in <<Configure IHub Routing Engine in Anypoint Studio>>.


== Copy IHub Information

In order to identify your IHub environment and its API Key to Anypoint Studio:

* <<Copy your Environment ID>>
* <<Identify or Create an API Key>>

=== Copy your Environment ID

. On the <<anypoint-partner-manager.adoc#img-IHub-start,B2B Transactions Page>>, in the left-hand navigation pane, click *Administration*, then click *Environments*.
. In the row that corresponds to the environment with which you are working, click *copy*.

=== Identify or Create an API Key

In order to create a Mule project, you must enter an xref:glossary#secta[API Key] and an .

If you have an existing API Key, use it. If you do not know the API Key, consult your organization's MuleSoft administrator.

If your organization has not created an API Key, you can use IHub to create one.

WARNING: The API Key is used by every Mule application across your entire Master xref:/access-management/organization[Organization] that communicates with PortX Integration Hub. Therefore, before you create a new API Key, coordinate with your organization's MuleSoft administrator to ensure that none of your organization's processes are using an existing API Key because, if they are, creating a new API Key will cause them to cease functioning. In that case, instead of creating a new API Key, use the existing API Key.

To obtain a key, see xref:administration#create-a-new-api-key[Create a New API Key].


== Configure IHub Routing Engine in Anypoint Studio
