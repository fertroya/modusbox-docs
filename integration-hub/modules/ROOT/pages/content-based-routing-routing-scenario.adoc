= Content-Based-Routing Routing Scenario

Here we have a Partner PartnerA who is sending us a Document Q. Depending on the size of a property in that document we want to either send that document to an endpoint DATABig or an endpoint DATASmall.


////
In this scenario, your organization receives a xref:glossary#D[Document] from a xref:glossary#P[Partner]. 
If IHub has been configured to receive a document of this xref:glossary#D[Document Type], IHub routes the document to an internal API. 
If IHub has not been configured to receive a document of this Document Type, IHub rejects the document.

== Relationships

There are two xref:glossary#R[Relationships] in this scenario:

.Content-Based Routing Scenario Relationships
[cols="3*"]

|===
|Relationship|Description|Contains

s|_YourCompany_ B2B : Any
|Universal relationship between your company any partner
|Contains Artifacts used across all partners with whom you do business

s|_YourCompany_ B2B : PartA
|Your organization's relationship with the partner with whom you are doing business (in this case, *PartA*)
|Contains Artifacts used only with Partner *PartA*

== xref:glossary#A[Artifact]s 

This section identifies:

* Artifacts that must be configured in order for the document in this scenario to be routed (that is, not rejected)
* The Relationship (either *_YourCompany_ B2B : Any* or *_YourCompany B2B_ : PartA*) in which the artifacts are configured

This transaction is the combination of the Source Channel Y-to-S and the Target Channel X-to-DATASmall. It also has a filter that checks for some propertyA to be Less Than 10. If a Document Y matches this filter then it will be a transaction that receives a document Q maps it to document C and then sends it to the database DATASmall. This transaction has the From Partner set to PartA and the To Partner set to Your Company B2B.

== Outcomes

If the artifacts in the previous section have been configured correctly, then document discussed above will be <<Document Accepted and Routed, accepted and routed>>. 

Otherwise, the document will be <<Document Rejected, rejected>>.


== Document Accepted and Routed

All artifacts are correctly configured; IHub routes an incoming document of Document Type *Y* from Partner *PartA* to Endpoint *RecFromA*.

[[img-content-based-routing-scenario-outcome-success]]

image::content-based-routing-scenario-outcome-success.png[img-content-based-routing-scenario-outcome-success, title="Content-Based Routing Scenario Outcome (Success)"]

Integration Hub:

* Receives a document of Document Type *Y*
* Attempts to resolve routes
** Finds a Transaction *Y-to-X-to-API* that contains *Y*.
* Executes Transaction *Y-to-X-to-API*, which transforms the Document from *X* to *Y*
* Sends the document to Endpoint *API*.




== Document Rejected

Partner *PartA* sends a document of Document Type *Z* to Endpoint *RecFromA*. 
Document Type *Z* is not configured in Relationship *_YourCompany_ B2B : Any*; IHub rejects the document. 

[[img-content-based-routing-scenario-outcome-rejection]]

image::content-based-routing-scenario-outcome-rejection.png[img-content-based-routing-scenario-outcome-rejection, title="Content-Based Routing Scenario Outcome (Rejection)"]

Integration Hub:

* Receives incoming document
* Attempts to resolve Routes
* Does not find a corresponding Transaction
* Rejects the document.
