= Basic Routing Scenario

In this scenario, your organization receives a xref:glossary#sectd[document] from a xref:glossary#sectp[Partner]. 
If IHub has been configured to receive a xref:glossary#sectd[document] of this xref:glossary#sectd[Document Type], IHub routes the xref:glossary#sectd[document] to an internal API. 
If IHub has not been configured to receive a xref:glossary#sectd[document] of this xref:glossary#sectd[Document Type], IHub rejects the document. 


== xref:glossary#secta[Actor]s

In this scenario, there are three xref:glossary#secta[Actor]s: 
    
* Partner A (configured as *PartA*)
* *_YourCompany_ B2B*
* *Any*

== xref:glossary#sectr[Relationship]s

There are two xref:glossary#sectr[Relationship]s in this scenario:

s|_YourCompany_ B2B : Any
|Universal xref:glossary#sectr[Relationship] between your company and any xref:glossary#secta[Actor]
|Contains xref:glossary#secta[Artifact]s used across all Partners with whom you do business

s|_YourCompany_ B2B : PartA
|Your organization's xref:glossary#sectr[Relationship] with the Partner with whom you are doing business (in this case, *PartA*)
|Contains xref:glossary#secta[Artifact]s used only with Partner *PartA*

== xref:glossary#secta[Artifact]s 

This section identifies:

* xref:glossary#secta[Artifact]s that must be configured in order for the xref:glossary#sectd[document] in this scenario to be routed (that is, not rejected)
* The xref:glossary#sectr[Relationship] (either *_YourCompany_ B2B : Any* or *_YourCompany B2B_ : PartA*) in which the xref:glossary#secta[Artifact]s are configured

== Outcomes

If the xref:glossary#secta[Artifact]s in the previous section have been configured correctly, then xref:glossary#sectd[document] discussed above will be <<Document Accepted and Routed, accepted and routed>>. 

Otherwise, the xref:glossary#sectd[document] will be <<Document Rejected, rejected>>.



== xref:glossary#sectd[document] Accepted and Routed

All xref:glossary#secta[Artifact]s are correctly configured; IHub routes an incoming xref:glossary#sectd[document] of xref:glossary#sectd[Document Type] *Y* from Partner *PartA* to xref:glossary#secte[Endpoint] *RecFromA*.

== xref:glossary#sectd[document] Rejected

Partner *PartA* sends a xref:glossary#sectd[document] of xref:glossary#sectd[Document Type] *Z* to xref:glossary#secte[Endpoint] *RecFromA*. 
xref:glossary#sectd[Document Type] *Z* is not configured in xref:glossary#sectr[Relationship] *_YourCompany_ B2B : Any*; IHub rejects the document.
