= Seven Days to Integration Hub Mastery

Welcome to Integration Hub! We've created a week-long digital integration tour with Captain Cooper, an IHub expert. Meet Cooper and get started with with IHub concepts in https://ihub-concepts[this video].


Daily activities consist of:

* A _video_ in which an IHub expert reiterates scenario concepts and shows you the actual IHub screens that enable this example of the scenario to work.

* A _tutorial_ that provides step-by-step instructions for implementing this example of the scenario in your environment.

After Day One, each day also stops by a _walkthrough_ that illustrates the broader concepts of the scenario.
