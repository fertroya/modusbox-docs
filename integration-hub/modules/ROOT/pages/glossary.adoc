API Key:: 32-bit alphanumeric universal unique identifier (UUID) string used by client applications to communicate with PortX. Be sure you fully understand how this key is used before you create it.

Application:: Software program or programs that have a role within your organization. 

Artifact:: Software component of the IHub system.

Document Definition:: A specific document format that is configured in the system.  A Document Definition is identified by the following pieces of information: Partner, Standard, Version, and Message Type. Schemas, Maps, and Document Properties are associated with a Document Definition.

Document properties:: Document properties are data fields that are extracted from received documents for the purpose of correlation, duplicate checking, and searching in the B2B Transactions screen.  
Document Properties are configured for Document Definitions.  The user provides the Name of the property and the path (XPath for XML, JSONPath for others) for retrieving the property from the document.  These properties are extracted and stored by the Tracking service.

Document Type:: IHub xref:glosary#secta[artifact] that identifies types of xref:glosary#sectd[document]s based on values such as xref:glosary#sects[standard] and xref:glosary#sectm[message type].

[[secte]]
*E*

Endpoint:: Entry point to a service, process, queue or topic destination. 

Environment ID:: String that uniquely identifies an xref:access-management/environments[Environment].

External Partner:: Any company registered in PortX that is not the Home Partner.

[[secth]]
*H*

Home Partner:: The company that is subscribing to Integration Hub, considered the “internal” partner.

[[sectl]]
*L*

Lookup Table:: A table that facilitates transaction processing by associating values.

[[sectm]]
*M*

Map:: Stores map type (XSLT or DataWeave) and script for transforming from one Document Definition to another Document Definition. 

Message Type:: One of several values that together define a xref:glossary#sectd[Document Type].

[[sectp]]
*P*

Partner:: A company that exchanges B2B messages.

Partner Identifier:: A predefined identifier of a particular Partner.  Partner Identifiers have Type and Qualifier that indicate the identifier scheme and Value.

[[sectr]]
*R*

Relationship:: Union of an actor with another actor or with all actors configured in your impleentation of IHub. 
Analagous to a programming namespace. 

Route:: IHub xref:glosary#seca[artifact] that connects a xref:glosary#sects[Source Channel] to a xref:glosary#sect[Target Channel].
 
[[sects]]
*S*

Schema:: The schema is stored with the Document Definition and is one of the following depending on the message type:

* XML: XSD file
* CSV: (NA)
* EDI: EDI Schema Language (ESL) file

Source Channel:: Type of xref:channel.adoc[Channel] specific to the source of a transmission. 

Standard:: One of several values that together define a xref:glossary#sectd[Document Type].

*E*

Standard PortX Field Format:: Describes fields for which valid values can include letters, numbers, or the dash ( *-* ) and underscore ( *_* ) characters.

[[sectt]]
*T*

Target Channel:: Type of xref:glossary#sectc[Channel] specific to the destination of a transmission. 


Transaction:: The end-to-end processing of a single instance of a document from receipt at an xref:glosary#secte[Endpoint] all the way to the desired business service.  
A *TransactionId* can be used to find metadata and persisted payloads for the transaction at each stage.

Transaction Definition:: The full configuration that configures how a document is processed between two partners.

Transaction-processing solution:: Functionality that serves as a translation layer between internal systems and the various formats (X12, EDIFACT, XML, CSV, and others) and transport protocols (AS2, FTP/S, and others) commonly used in electronic transactions between companies.

Transaction-Processing Framework:: B2B transaction-processing solution that enables developers to build a single set of xref:mule-user-guide[Mule Runtime] flows that can process a wide range of messages from many different partners by dynamically applying rules and configuration data stored in xref:anypoint-integration-hub[PortX] (PortX)
