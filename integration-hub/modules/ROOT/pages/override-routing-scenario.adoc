= Override Routing Scenario

In this scenario, your organization expects to receive xref:glossary#sectd[document]s of a single xref:glossary#sectd[Document Type] from multiple xref:glossary#sectp[Partner]s.


If the IH has been configured to receive a document of this xref:glossary#sectd[Document Type], IH routes the document to an internal API. 

However, one partner uses a variation of the Document Type, so you must override the standard xref:glossary#sectm[Map] that you use to transform that partner's Document Type to your internal Document Type before routing.

If IH has not been configured to receive a document of this Document Type, IH rejects the document. 


== Relationships, Artifacts, and Transactions

There are four xref:glossary#sectr[Relationships] in this scenario. Artifacts are distributed among the relationships according to how they are used. For example, the internal Endpoint *E|API* is used in all scenarios, so it is configured in the *YourCompany B2B : Any* Relationship. The Endpoints *E|RecFromA*, *E|RecFromB,* and *E|RecFromC* are used only by specific partners; therefore they are configured in the relationships that correspond to those partners. 
<<Override Routing Scenario Relationships, Table 1>> describes these Relationships and identifies their contents.

== Artifacts and Artifact Configuration 

This tables and flow diagrams in this section identifies:

* Artifacts that must be configured in order for a given document to be routed (that is, not rejected)
* The Relationship in which the artifacts are configured

=== YourCompany B2B : Any

Artifacts in this Relationship are accessible from all Partner Relationships. 
Therefore, these artifacts, tabulated in <<Override Routing Scenario Artifacts - YourCompany B2B : Any, Table 2>>, appear in each of the Transaction diagrams that follow.

== Outcomes

If all artifacts in the following table are configured appropriately, then the outcome of any of the partners in the scenario sending a document of *DT\|Y* to the Endpoint specific to their relationship with *YourCompany B2B* is that IH will route the document to that Endpoint. 

If any artifact in the relationship between the partner and *YourCompany B2B* or in *YourCompany B2B : Any* is incorrectly configured (or not configured at all), then IH will reject the document.
