== Artifacts and Artifact Configuration 

This section identifies:

* Artifacts that must be configured in order for the document in this scenario to be routed (that is, not rejected)
* The Relationship (either *__YourCompany__ B2B : Any* or *__YourCompany__ B2B : PartA*, or *__YourCompany__ B2B : PartB*) in which the artifacts are configured


//==== Configured in *YourCompany B2B : Any*

== Outcomes

=== *PartA* sends Document of Document Type *Y* to Endpoint *RecFromA*

Integration Manager:

* Receives Document *Y*
** Attempts to resolve routes
** Finds Transaction *Y-to-X-to-API*
* Executes that transaction, which maps the transaction to *X*
*  Sends Document *X* to Endpoint *API*.



=== *PartB* sends Document of Document Type *Y* to Endpoint *RecFromB*

Integration Manager:

* Receives Document *Y*
* Attempts to resolve routes
** Finds Transaction *Y-to-X-to-API*
** Executes that transaction, which maps the transaction to *X*
*  Sends Document *X* to Endpoint *API*.



=== PartC sends Document of Document Type *X* to Endpoint *RecFromB*

Integration Manager:

* Receives document X
* Attempts to resolve routes
** Does not find a corresponding transaction.
* Rejects the document
